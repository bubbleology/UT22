<h1 align="left">UT22</h1>

UT22 is a 22 key column-staggered choc unibody keyboard that is intended to be used with the Artsey or Taipo layout. It's essentially a left and right handed artsey/taipo board in a single body with extra thumbs and pinky keys. It uses a Nice!Nano and the PCB supports a Nice!View display.

## PCB

If you like to get a PCB to build your own UT22 you'll find the source files and a Gerber file [here](/PCB/).

***

### BOM

For a complete build you'll additionally need the following components:
- 22x SMD diodes (SOD-123)
- 22x Kailh Choc Hotswap Sockets
- 22x Kailh Choc V1 Switches
- 1x Nice!Nano
- 2× Pair of female headers for the N!N
- (optional) 1x Nice!View
- (optional) 1x Lipo battery (301230)
- (optional) 1x Power switch (MSK 12C02)
- (optional) 1x Reset switch (B3U-1000P(M))

## FIRMWARE

UT22 runs on ZMK. To modify and compile your own keymap you can clone the dedicated [ZMK config repository](https://github.com/bubbleology/zmk-config-ut22).

## CREDITS

I've collected and built many different ergo boards but never got around to building my own PCB mainly due to the lack of available and especially easy to understand resources to get started. With the very comprehensive and wonderfully written article [Let's Design A Keyboard with Ergogen](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/) by FlatFootFox I had no more excuses to not at least try and design my own PCB, so I went for it.

With the help of the lovely and very supportive german ergo community I was finally able to finish my own PCB design. So special thanks goes out to:
